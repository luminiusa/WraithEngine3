WraithEngine

WraithEngine is a Java-based game engine, developed by Wraithaven Games, built around the concept of mixing various plugins to make games.

Why Use It?

Yes, there's a lot of other game engines out there. Most are significantly nicer than this one. But the goal of WraithEngine is not to compete with them, but to offer a fun new way to develop games.

In addition, there are many advantages for using WraithEngine over writing your own engine. First, WraithEngine takes care of most of the low level game engine code. So you don't need to worry about loading the correct rendering engine, or tweak optimization for hours. You can dive right into the higher level game logic. Secondly, with such a heavy focus on modding, WraithEngine allows for individuals to make their own games by simply mixing and matching different plugins without having to worry about writing their own. Even those who have never made a game in their life can make very few modpacks that take the player on an adventure without needing to understand what's going on under the hood.
